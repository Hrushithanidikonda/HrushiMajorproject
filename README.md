Credit Risk Analysis and Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
## Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict credit risk and detect fraudulent transactions using the UCI Credit Default Dataset.

## Features
- Predict credit risk using ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks).
- Detect fraudulent activities based on historical transaction patterns.
- Evaluate model performance using AUC-ROC, F1-score, and precision-recall metrics.
